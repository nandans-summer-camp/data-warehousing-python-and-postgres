# Python and Postgres

This exercise is pretty straight forward, we're just combining the last two! You will need to:

1. Create a python file that loads the data (`orders.json`) into a Postgres database with normalized tables.

2. Include a `.sql` file that creates the tables in the format required (this can be the same file as you made in the last exercise!).

Your code should allow me to : A) create a database with tables from your `.sql` file and B) load the data from `orders.json` into that database.

Finally, you will:

3. Commit and push!

You should take a look at [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) to learn about how to use Python as a Postgres client to send data to a Postgres database!
